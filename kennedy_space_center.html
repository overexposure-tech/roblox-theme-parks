            I don't think this game is official. That's why I'm gonna go lightly here. The gameplay: is boring. It took me around an hour to complete this experience and even then I didn't play through the whole thing.

            There is very long waiting times between spaceship launch and other things. Even when you reach the goalpoint in the progressbar, sometimes it doesn't even load when you get to the progress point.

            There is this weird minigame thing that I personally could not exit where you moved the ISS around. I'm not sure what you were supposed to do, as it is very vague.

            I don't think this game necessarily meant to be played like a <i>theme park</i>, but was meant to be a realistic space shuttler launch simulator. The experience is intended to be played with multiple people, however, I played by myself.

            The map left you on places you didn't want to be for very long periods of time and left you the places you wanted to explore very bland.

            There was very little audio in the game, and I felt a little music could do good anywhere in this game.
