            This park was themed well, if you stayed in first person mode the whole time. However, in third person mode, if you zoomed out, then you could see how little effort the developers put into backing the treeline. On coasters, zooming out all the way reveals the baseplate underneath coated a nice green texture to make it look better.

            Theres also this very annoying system where you have to eat every once in a while. It's a <i>video game</i>. Why do I have to eat?
        </p>

            If you are always zoomed out like I am, then you may notice the lack of music. The music only starts playing when you are close enough to a music point, which becomes very annoying.
        </p>

            Even if you are zoomed in, in some places, the music overlaps. It might be even worse than when you are zoomed out.

            I also noticed that some rides ran with zero people on them just to make the park <i>look</i> busy.

            The server I got placed in was decently populated, however it seemed there was no one around.

            The queuing system works similarly to the one at Roblox Universal, however it was odd because it had a timer for when the next could come rather than train cars at a time. I never understand why Roblox theme parks must be like this.

            When riding rides, especially on <b>Accelerator</b>, there is a noticing lack of trees. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the rides are fairly decent. So is the camera system. That's what saved it from getting a 1/10. This will bump it up to 4/10. However, you can just stay on the ride, and it won't kick you off. So you can ride something forever. This is why I bumped it down a point to 3/10.
