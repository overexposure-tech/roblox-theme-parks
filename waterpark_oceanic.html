        <p>
            This park was pretty cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            The theming was... okay. There could've been more plant life.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also get huge jump abilities... and there are no barriers. So you can really get anywhere on the map.
        </p>
        <p>
            They offer bathing suites for your character to equip and also... skin colors? Weird choice... but ok.
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost every button on the UI is a purchase button and when you spawn in you get an immediate portal ad. But this one gets a plus because there's a button to report bugs.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of this will be split up into the parks different areas.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Ice World
        </h3>
        <p>
            Next to the actual Cave Crawler tube, there is this odd tube where there is no station, and it leads from one part of the Jungle to another. I don't know what this is.
        </p>
        Rides/Attractions:
        <ul>
            <li>

        <h3>
            Jungle
        </h3>
        <p>
            My favorite ride from this area was <i>Tarzan and Jane</i>. In this area, there's a parkour area which would definitely not be allowed in real life (Take that how you will).
        </p>
        <p>
            There are only 2 rides, but 3 attractions.
        </p>
        Rides/Attractions:
        <ul>
            <li>

        </ul>
        <h3>
            Fey's Adventure
        </h3>
        <p>
            This area is literally just a big water slide. My character hit the side of the tube and came to a stop, so I didn't get to enjoy the full ride.
